 * This module analyses the contents of 'before' and 'after' flash images and

 *
 * The goal is to prepare actions using the chip's erase capability in a most
 * efficient way: erasing smallest possible portions of the chip gives the
 * highest granularity, but if many small areas need to be erased, erasing a
 * larger area, even if re-writing it completely, is more efficient. The
 * breakdown is somewhere at 60%.
 *
 * Each flash chip description in flash.c includes a set of erase command
 * descriptors, different commands allowing to erase blocks of fixed different
 * sizes. Sometimes the erase command for a certain block size does not cover
 * the entire chip. This module preprocesses the flash chip description to
 * compile an array of erase commands with their block size indices such that
 * it is guaranteed that the command can be used to erase anywhere in the chip
 * where erase is required based on the differences between 'before' and
 * 'after' images.
 *
 * 'eraser_index' below is the index into the 'block_erasers' array of the
 * flash chip descriptor, points to the function to use to erase the block of
 * a certain size.
 *
 * The erase command could potentially operate on blocks of different sizes,
 * 'region_index' is the index into the 'block_erasers.eraseblocks' array
 * which defines what block size would be used by this erase command.
